# MerkleTreeRoot

Computing Merkle Tree Root implementation in Elixir.

Project contains three approaches:
- basic - computing loaded list of all hashes recursively level by level to reach tree root,
- with use of Streams - running Stream build recursively number of times to reach tree root,
- with use of `Task.async_stream/3` - using parts of approach above with additional chunking the stream to use concurrency.

Looking at benchmarks result below for given data set the basic one is the fastest and the most efficient of all implemented approaches.

Why did I implemented three approaches and compared them? Simply out of my curiosity.

## Requirements

Installed Elixir v1.13 and Erlang v24.2 or asdf (https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) with Elixir and Erlang plugins.

Having asdf installed run:

```bash
asdf install
```

## Run

```bash
mix deps.get
mix compile
...
iex -S mix
```

```elixir
iex> MerkleTreeRoot.compute_root_from_file(:list, "input.txt")
```

## Benchmarks

Compare approaches by running:

```bash
mix run samples/run.exs
```
